The project **Pomodoro Totoro Timer** consits on a timer that makes a sound when reaching 0. It has 2 modes: focus time (25 minutes) and rest time (5 minutes).

But, how far can this go?

## Features

- Authentication: You can log in using Github, Google or by creating an account with your email.
- Audio Storage: Tired of the basic sound played when the timer reaches its end? Upload your own audio, and access it each time you log in!
- Responsive design: The app is able to adapt to any device. Design mostly generated by [v0](https://v0.dev).
- Deployment: This project is available everywhere thanks to [Vervel](https://vercel.com)!
